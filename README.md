#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software. It ensures that software is reliable, scalable, and efficient while meeting user requirements and business needs.
Importance:

Enhances software quality and reliability

Reduces development costs and time-to-market

Ensures maintainability and scalability

Supports complex systems and large-scale applications
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1950s-1960s: Birth of Software Engineering – The term "software engineering" was coined to address the software crisis caused by increasing software complexity.

1970s-1980s: Structured Programming & Waterfall Model – The introduction of structured programming improved code readability and maintainability. The Waterfall model provided a structured approach to development.

1990s-Present: Agile, DevOps, and AI-driven Development – Agile methodologies revolutionized software development, emphasizing adaptability and customer feedback. DevOps streamlined software deployment, and AI-driven development introduced automation in coding and testing.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning – Define project goals, feasibility, and scope.

Requirements Analysis – Gather and document user needs.

Design – Create architectural and detailed design specifications.

Implementation – Write and integrate the code.

Testing – Verify that the software meets requirements and is bug-free.

Deployment – Release the software to users.

Maintenance – Update, fix bugs, and enhance features over time.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall: Approach,Linear and sequential
           Changes,Difficult to accommodate

Agile:  Easily adaptable to changes
          Approach is iterative and non linear


Waterfall: Used in safety-critical systems like medical devices where requirements must be clearly defined before development begins.

Agile: Used in web and mobile app development where customer feedback and iterative improvements are crucial.
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer – Writes, tests, and maintains code.

Quality Assurance Engineer – Ensures software quality through testing.

Project Manager – Plans, oversees, and coordinates the project timeline and resources.
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) improve coding efficiency by providing code completion, debugging tools, and build automation. Examples: Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA.

Version Control Systems (VCS) track changes in code, allowing collaboration and rollback to previous versions. Examples: Git, SVN.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Keeping up with technology → Continuous learning and training.

Debugging complex issues → Implementing rigorous testing and debugging techniques.

Managing project deadlines → Using project management tools (e.g., Jira, Trello).

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing – Tests individual components.

Integration Testing – Ensures modules work together.

System Testing – Verifies the whole system.

Acceptance Testing – Confirms software meets user requirements.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering involves crafting effective input prompts to optimize AI model responses. It enhances AI usability, efficiency, and accuracy in generating desired outputs.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt: "Tell me about cars."

Improved Prompt: "Explain the differences between electric and gasoline-powered cars, focusing on efficiency, cost, and environmental impact."

Why it's more effective:

It specifies the type of cars (electric vs. gasoline-powered).

It defines the key aspects of comparison (efficiency, cost, environmental impact).

It ensures a focused and relevant response.
